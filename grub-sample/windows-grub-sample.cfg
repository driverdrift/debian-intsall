# For latest debian os, it is not recommanded to edit /boot/grub/grub.cfg, 
# because it is automatically generated by grub-mkconfig using templates 
# from /etc/grub.d and settings from /etc/default/grub
# You can edit /etc/grub.d/40_custom to add your custom menu entries. But be
# careful not to change the 'exec tail' line above. Just write raw menuentry on it rather than script.
# It will automatically add in grub.cfg after run `sudo update-grub` .
# As for windows, chainloader +1 is necessary. Because unlike linux loading kernel and initrd for grub, 
# windows rely on its bootloader which is usually in first sector in system partition called boot sector.
# Run `sudo update-grub` after edit /etc/grub.d/40_custom file.
menuentry "My Windows 11" {
	set root='hd0,gpt1'
